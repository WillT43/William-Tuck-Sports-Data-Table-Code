# William-Tuck-Sports-Data-Table-Code
This is the code for my application for the Engineering Intern position at Sports Reference. I created a simple Python program that takes the JSON data provided in the prompt and creates a table with the format requested. The program extracts the teams present in the data and creates an array. With this array, a for loop is used to iterate through the array, gather the desired data, and print in the format outlined. The comments in the code specify the for-loop execution.
